            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Peripateticks<note place="margin">Peripateticks.</note> make two ſorts of bleſſednes, the one conſisting in action, which is politike or ciuill; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in contemplation, which they call wiſdome.

Thus ſome of them haue gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in the darknes of this world, for that which cannot be found here: and others haue ſoared aloft, but yet far too ſhort in finding out that resting poynt, whereat e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one ought to aime.<note place="margin">True religion the meanes to attaine our well fare, and what true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is.</note> How the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> must we attaine vnto it? ſurely by that which they knew not, that is to wit, true religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: which is the right rule of ſeruing God, &amp; of reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting
<pb facs="tcp:12523:3"/> ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto him, that he may be ſaued: of the which true religion there be three eſpeciall marks, ſo much the more worthy of deepe impreſsion in our minds, becauſe many fooliſh ceremonies haue diſguiſed themſelues in the attire of true religion.</p>
            <p>The first marke is,<note place="margin">The firſt marke of true religion.</note> to worſhip the onely God of Iſrael: wherein behold how Sathan hath tyrannized ouer mankind, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forge as many gods, as they had fancies: as that people in Africke, who worſhipped that which they met firſt in the morning; or the Aſſyrians, that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped as many gods as they had townes; or the Perſians,<note place="margin">Mans vanitie being deſtitute of Gods word.</note> that worſhipped as many gods as there be fires in the earth, or ſtars in the skie; or the Aegyptia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped as many gods as they had plants or trees; or the Romans, who ſubduing nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wan their ſuperstitions, &amp; ſo became the ſinck-pan of Idolatries. In a word, the diuell by Gods permiſsion ſo deluded the world, that ſome made gods of their goods, ſome worſhipped the beasts which
<pb facs="tcp:12523:4"/> God gaue them for their benefite, ſome builded Temples to their paſsions, ſome made gods of themſelues, ſome deified their kings, as the Aegyptians their king <hi>Apis,</hi> the Babylonians their <hi>Belus,</hi> the Macedonians their <hi>Cabyrus,</hi> the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines their <hi>Faunus,</hi> the Sabines their <hi>Saucus,</hi> the Romans their <hi>Quirinus:</hi> what Christians will not ſhudder at the rememberance of ſuch mysteries, when <hi>Euripides</hi> could ſpeake thus:
<q>
                  <l>
                     <note place="margin">Euripides.</note>Thou <hi>Neptune,</hi> and thou <hi>Iupiter</hi> likewiſe,</l>
                  <l>with other gods, whom faining words diſguiſe,</l>
                  <l>If that due Iuſtice vnto you were doone,</l>
                  <l>both heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; temples ſhould be emptie ſoone.</l>
               </q> Then the first chiefe note of the true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is, that the true immortall God be onely worſhipped, who founded the earth, and ſtretched out his meat-line ouer it, who ſhutteth vp the ſea within the banks, and boundeth the waters, who maketh light and darknes, holdeth backe the Pleiades; and vnbindeth Orion, who ſpreadeth out the heauens like a curtaine,
<pb facs="tcp:12523:4"/> and maketh his chambers in the depths, who maketh the windes his meſſengers, and the elements his ſeruants. This I ſay is the true God, who in his worſhip admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth no collaterall companions: and as for the reſt, gods in name, and not in nature, they are like vnto dog leaches, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe but the curing of one diſeaſe onely, or common craftſmen which profeſſe but the skill of ſome one myſterie.</p>
            <p>The ſecond marke of true religion is,<note place="margin">The ſecond marke of true religion.</note> that we ſerue this onely God aright. As for the Philoſophers, they alſo were prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at this poynt, but ſo that they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies too wide or too ſhort: for which of them euer ſaid that God is a ſpirite, and ought to be ſerued in ſpirite? True it is, they ſet downe many morall precepts for direction of mens manners: but when they come to the matters of God, they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpeake of them dreamingly, or deeme of them ouerthwartly; yea, the ſeruices of God, inuented by man, are but ſo many childiſh imaginations, not onely vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming
<pb facs="tcp:12523:5"/> the maiestie of God, but farre in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to the diſcretion of a man: as ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings, ſtage plaies, running of horſes, ſword playings, wraſtlings, buffetings, and ſuch like. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicks, commendeth a certaine anſwere of <hi>Symonides</hi> to <hi>Hieron.</hi> King of Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, which was, that none but God ought to haue skill of things that are aboue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, much leſſe then to diſpoſe of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is, to ſhew the meanes how to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount nature. The countrie clowne ſhould ſhew himſelfe ridiculous, if hee ſhould take vpon him to ſet downe how his Prince ſhould be ſerued: and yet is he a man as well as his Prince, differing in ſtate, and not in nature. What is to be ſaid then of man, being a worme, &amp; leſſe then a worme, in reſpect of the euerliuing God, if he will needs preſcribe him his ſeruice? Surely as none can ſee the ſunne, but by the helpe of the ſunne; ſo none can ſerue God,<note place="margin">The third marke of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> but by the light of his word.</p>
            <p>There is a third marke, without the
<pb facs="tcp:12523:5"/> which religion (although in it ſelfe the path to ſaluation) is nothing elſe but a booke wherein we reade the ſentence of our owne deaths. Therefore religion muſt ſhew vs a meanes to ſatiſfie Gods Iuſtice: without the which, not onely all other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, but euen that which conteineth the true ſeruice of God were vnauaile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Indeed mans reaſon perceiued that ſome meanes was needful to make attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but what it was, reaſon was too ſhallow to finde out. The Platoniſts haue buſied themſelues about many clenſings, but to ſmall purpoſe: others ſay it muſt bee done by abſtinence, good behauiour, <hi>Iupiters</hi> myſteries, &amp;c. <hi>Hierocles</hi> ſaid, that religion is the ſtudie of wiſdome, which conſiſteth in perfecting and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing our ſelues, that men may be at one with God: which perfection alſo, ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in confeſsion of ſinnes (as he ſaith) but alas, whereas in religion we looke for life, vpon confeſsion followeth death. Then to finde a planke to ſaue vs from
<pb facs="tcp:12523:6"/> ſhipwrack, religion ſheweth three perſons in vnitie, of one eſſence coeternal, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall in all reſpects: the Father as the ground and wellſpring: the Sonne as the euerlaſting word and wiſdome of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and the holy Ghoſt as the bond of loue, whereby the Father and the Sonne are linked together. The one of theſe muſt make attonement: for God himſelfe muſt be faine to ſtep in betwixt his Iuſtice and his mercie, and as he created vs at the firſt, ſo to create vs new againe: and as he created vs in fauour, ſo now to acquite vs from wrath: and as he vttered his power and wiſdome in making vs, ſo now to vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his wiſdome and goodnes in repairing vs. But yet beholde a myſterie, this infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite godhead is not to diſcharge our diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,<note place="margin">Theſe ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode by a communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, as the like, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28</note> otherwiſe then with obedience, nor our vndeſert, otherwiſe then with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, nor our pride, otherwiſe then with lowlines, neither is he to purchaſe grace but by puniſhment, nor a crowne but by ſuffering, neither life but by death. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:12523:6"/> would hee abaſe himſelfe that hee might obey; ſerue, that he might deſerue, ſtoope downe beneath himſelfe, that hee might become lowly; become weake, that he might ſuffer; become mortall, that he might die. Therefore was it behoouefull that our mediatour ſhould be God and man: man to be borne vnder the law, God to performe the law; man to ſerue, God to ſet free: man to humble himſelfe to the vttermoſt, God to exalt himſelfe aboue all things; man to ſuffer, God to ouercome; man to die, and God to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph ouer death. And ſythence it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him of his infinit goodnes to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for vs, himſelfe no way bound, needs muſt his obedience become a diſcharge for the diſobedience; his deſert, a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the vndeſert, &amp; his ſufferings a ſatisfaction for the ſtubburnnes of them that beleeue in him. Now then if religion ſhould but ſend vs to the true God, what were that more then the ſending of an offender to the Iudge, or a laying of
<pb facs="tcp:12523:7"/> ſtubble to the fire, conſidering that God is infinitly good, and man infinitly euill. Secondly, and if in religion we ſhould but reade the will of the creator, what haue we yet found ſince mankinde is corrupt from his roote, and rotten at the core; but our owne enditements, arraigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and condemnations? Therefore this third note of religion, by making ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for ſins by the death of Chriſt, is the verie ſubſtance, and in ſhape of it, without the which it ſhould be altogether vnprofitable. Now all this ſerueth first to ſhew you the tyrannie of Sathan ouer mankinde, and the horrible darkenes whereinto it is plunged, being deſtitute of the aide of Gods word and his holy ſpirit. Secondly, how greatly we are bound to receiue our gracious calling, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Gods holy religion, by which we are brought to that ſoueraigne good, for the which wee were made and created, and without the which hauing all things elſe, yet are most miſerable: for proofe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb facs="tcp:12523:7"/> hast thou the authoritie and ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie of a Prince. Let Princes ſay whether one rebellion of their ſubiects doe not more vexe them,<note place="margin">No welfare to be found in this world.</note> than all their honorable triumphs can reioyce them. Art thou exalted to honour? let honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable perſons ſay whether they bee not ſpitefull or ſpited, doing miſchiefe, or receiuing miſchiefe, ouermating or ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated. Honour is but vertues ſhadow, a winde that makes many ſwell, but cannot ſatiſfie. Art thou rich and wealthie? Let Merchants ſay what wealth is worth, ſince ſea can drowne it, fire conſume it, pyrates and robbers bereaue vs of it. To loue riches, is to doe as children doe, which take their greatest delite in pins and checkstones: or as fooles, which ſhould deeme the goodnes of an horſe to conſist in his ſtrappings. Art thou beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull? Let the daughters of vanitie ſay whether the ſunne doth not tanne it, or a ſtarre doth not blemiſh it, or ſickenes doth not waste it, or olde age doth not
<pb facs="tcp:12523:8"/> weare it. Beautie is but a vaine thing, and gladdeth more the beholders, then the hauers. Art thou ſtrong and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie? Let al the world ſay whether mans bodie be not ſubiect to a thouſand diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, fraught with frailties within, wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in miſeries without; vncertaine of life, ſure of death. Now what are all theſe and the rest, but reſemblances of the apples that grow about Sodome, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to the eye, and prouoking to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, but vaniſhing into ſmoke, being touched with the teeth? Therefore it is onely true religion that leadeth Prince and people, noble and vnnoble, rich and poore to true felicitie, and reuniteth them vnto God. Happie be that day, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from aboue, in the which God gaue vs this token of his fauour: let that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth be reſpected of God, and let it be the head of the yeare: let all ſuch as loue their ſaluations, bleſſe that day wherein they were redeemed from the darkenes of Sodom, and of Aegypt, and the day
<pb facs="tcp:12523:8"/> ſtarre of righteouſneſſe appeared vpon them: yea let it be made the beginning of the ſupputation of yeares, as we reade that the Iewes reckened their yeares from the yeares of Iubilee, and from the find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the law in <hi>Ioſiahs</hi> time: for then commeth the true yeare of Iubilee, the yeare of freedome and deliuerance from bondage, when the Goſpell which is the glad tidings of ſaluation commeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs.</p>

               <p>The meanes whereby Mahomet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the world, were as followeth. This new Captaine many could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide; his manners were ſo monſtrous: beſides, he was vexed with the falling ſicknes; therefore to redeeme himſelfe from this contempt, pretended a diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie in his doings, faining himſelfe to conferre with God, and ſo to be rauiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of himſelfe: and that he was no more a prince elected through fauour of ſouldiers, but a meſſenger of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie. Hauing laid this foundation politickely, he beginneth to make a mingle-mangle of all religions: For to allure the Iewes, he exalted <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and retained circumciſion; not to eſtraunge the Chriſtians, he confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:12523:61"/> Chriſt to be the ſpirit, word and power of God; to pleaſe the Neſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, he ſaid that Chriſt was not verie God, nor the ſonne of God, but that he had indeed the ſoule of God.</p>
               <p>The Foxe laieth a foundation for his abſurdities and blaſphemies,<note place="margin">The ſecond ſemblance in the ground plot of enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging theit kingdomes.</note> much like that of the Lion: for as Mahomet coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened the world, in making it beleeue that he entered communication with God, when he fell into his fit of the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſickenes: ſo the Pope whileſt he maketh thouſands beleeue that he is Gods vicar, as the other made his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that he was, and is Gods meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and that he cannot erre in giuing ſentence, though he may ſlip as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate perſon, poiſoneth the Church with peſtilent opinions, and draweth whole cart-lodes of ſoules after him into hell fire. The groundworke once laid, that the Pope cannot erre: then like to Mahomet beginneth hee to make an hotch-potch of hereſies, as to worſhip Chriſt and other ſaints, with the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocratians; to worſhip the virgine <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> with the Collyridians; to paint God like an old man, with the Anthropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphits;

               <p>The third ſemblance is in the likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of their blaſphemies againſt Chriſt,<note place="margin">The third ſem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>blance in broaching their blaſph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Pope denieth not the perſon of the great ſonne of God, for then ſhould he not be Antichriſt; but yet if you marke well how he degradeth him of his dignities, you ſhall ſee that Chriſt is much alike beholden to them both, and that euerie one may vnderſtand what his flatterers giue him, and what he

He can make holy that which is vnholy, pardon ſins, iuſtifie the wicked, diſpenſe againſt the old and new Teſtament.

               <p>But we muſt remember here that as Mahomet hauing renounced the perſon

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or the better auoyding of theſe enemies ſo peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and pernicious, it is furder to be conſidered, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſundry ſortes of them are crept into the Church, to ſupplant and vndermine it: for ſome are heretikes, either denying the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the great ſonne of God, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grading him from his offices, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting his word with a million of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, of whom hath been intreated before, and more ſhall be ſpoken here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. Others are ſchiſmatikes, who without cauſe depart away from the communion of the Church: others are hypocrites, or counterfeit chriſtians, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in name, but more than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed indeede, who by their ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:12523:67"/> manners, and wicked examples, waſte and deſtroy the vines, eſpecially the yong ones. Which ſort of Foxes are otherwiſe called ſcabd ſheepe, and are compared to leauen which ſowreth the whole lumpe, of which the Apoſtle giueth vs a rule, in the perſon of the inceſtuous ſinner, that we ſhould not companie together: If any that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a brother be a fornicatour,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. Hereticall Foxes recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant papiſtes.</note> or coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, or an Idolater, or a railour, or a drunkard, or an extortioner, with ſuch an one eate not.</p>
               <p>Of Foxes infected with hereſie, which do eſpecially diſturbe the church of England, there be two ſorts; the one called recuſants, becauſe they haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken our fellowſhip; the other church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haunts, who with falſe hearts frequent our aſſemblies, temporizing for feare of a fine, or furder penaltie. The firſt ſort plead Baals cauſe with open mouth, deſpiſe the Lords temple in Ieruſalem, poſt from Dan to Bethel to pleaſe <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam,</hi> hate our congregations, and count it damnable to tread in our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies. If theſe Foxes were as ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſhed, as they are eaſilie diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:12523:68"/> we ſhuld not haue ſo many Maſſes, neither ſo many goe to Maſſe; and yet Maſſe rated at ſo round a reckning. I need not ſtand to mark out theſe mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part merchaunts, their practiſe betraies the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they ſhow outwardly how they are affected inwardly; old doting dames, and yoong minions, old fooliſh fathers, and yoong boyes, that cannot tell why they were borne, ſpeake bouldlie for Poperie in defiance of the Goſpel, refuſe the Church, and checke the reprouer, make a mocke of the miniſterie, and ſcorne true religion; and yet haue peace and proſperitie. If a prince be miſuſed, death is thought too ſmal a puniſhment for the offender; if a man be ſo wicked as to procure an inſurrection, or raiſe a rebellion, he muſt looſe his head for it, and good reaſon: But whereas God hath ſoueraigne dominion ouer all, a worme of the earth ſhall ſet himſelfe againſt him, deface his maieſtie, rob him of his honour, blaſpheme his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed name, yet eſcapeth without ſeueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of puniſhment, and that is no good religion. Theſe are thoſe wretched peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that haue ſould themſelues to be
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:12523:68"/> vaſſals of iniquitie, and haue receiued the ſtamp of the beaſt in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, that are readie to lie in waite for the Lords annoynted, and haue curſed <hi>Dauid</hi> to his face. Theſe are the ſonnes of thoſe bloudie fathers, that haue mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the prophets. Theſe are the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie of <hi>Amelech,</hi> vnworthie to liue amongſt <hi>Iſraell,</hi> which haue ſerued <hi>Baal Hamon,</hi> and haue runne vnto the golden calues of Dan and Bethel. Theſe are the relikes of Iebus, and the remnants of the Hittites, that haue bin pricks and thornes in the ſides of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous men, and will be kniues to our throats if that might come which their harts faint in waiting for: but the ſame God that hath hitherto preſerued vs, detected their diſſembled zeale, and ſheathed their ſworde in their owne intrals, ſhall ſtill continew our moſt gratious protectour, vnleſſe the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing ſtreames of our ſinnes ſtop the courſe of his mercies, and eclipſe the brightnes of his fauour, which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto hath ſhined vpon vs.<note place="margin">Church pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts.</note>
               </p>
               <p>There is an other ſorte of Foxes in nature, not much different from the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:12523:69"/> former, but yet not ſo eaſilie deſcribed, neither are they oftentimes reputed as they are.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">A token ſent from the old Foxe to his yoong cubs.</note>It is not many yeares agoe, ſince there came a token from the old gray Foxe to the cubs of his kind; wherein was printed the fiue wounds of Chriſt, with this poeſie, <hi>fili da mihi cor tuum,</hi> that is, ſonne giue me thy hart: whereby it appeareth that either Rainard was ſo well diſpoſed as to maintaine diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, or els his brood were in a wrong boxe, for they tooke his embleme in no other meaning. Therefore haue they learned to temporize, and with double hearts to halt on both ſides, hauing one for God, and another for Baal; one for the prince,<note place="margin">Temporizing papiſts deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.</note> and an other for the Pope; one for the Maſſe, and another for the communion. The manner of theſe for the moſt part is to peepe into the Church once in a month, but preaching their queaſie ſtomakes cannot away with, eſpeciallie if Idolatrie and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtrie be diſcouered. I cannot more fitly compare theſe, than to cunning watermen, who looke one way, when they take their iourney an other: or to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:12523:69"/> 
                  <hi>Cacus</hi> that notorions robber, of whom it is recorded, that he was wont to drag beaſts backward into his Caue by their tailes, to the intent that by contrary tracke of their feete, he might be freed from the ſuſpition of felonie: euen ſo the popular demeanour of theſe hollow minded votaries, lookes one way, when their ſecret plots and practiſes tend an other; and when they come to the Church, they doe but drag backward with <hi>Cacus,</hi> hiding their hollow hearts vnder ſhow of conformitie: yea how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer theſe deepe diſſemblers in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance, ſhow milde and gentle, promiſing all loyaltie to their prince, agreement to gouernment, and conſent to religion; yet truſt them not, for a Foxe will ſhow himſelfe a Foxe, when time ſerues his turne.</p>
               <p>The poets wittily faine, that when Iupiter had made man,<note place="margin">A poeticall fiction fitlie applied.</note> being delited with ſuch a cunning peece of worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, he demaunded of <hi>Momus</hi> finde-fault, what he could ſpy, in ſo fine a feature and curious frame, out of ſquare and worthie iuſt reproofe: <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> commended the proportion, and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:12523:70"/> comely diſpoſition of the lineaments; but one thing (ſaith he) I like not well, that thou haſt forgotten to place a window in his breſt, through which we might behold whether his heart and his tongue did accord. If a window were framed in the breſts of theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented catholikes, that her maieſtie and the ſtate-guiding counſell, and all the true friends of this kingdome might know their ſecret intentions; or if their conſciences were as deeply ſounded, as they may be iuſtly doubted: then I know full well that many falſe hearts would be found lurking vnder painted hoodes, and cakes of foule cancred malice, vnder meale mouthed proteſtations; neither would it bee troubleſome to finde out a two-legged Foxe; or if the coles of long feſtered choler were of that condition, as that being heaped together in their mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious minds, they could bliſter their tongues, or ſcald their lippes, we ſhould neede no further ſearch to finde out a Romaine catholike. Howbeit although they haue no windowes in their breſtes, wherethrough wee may ſee into euery
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:12523:70"/> corner of their conſciences, how they packe and ſhuffle now; and (as it is greatly to be feared) meane to cut alſo if Poperie ſhould get the vpper hand; yea although they ſhrowd their wicked deuiſes with a vaile of obſcuritie, and contriue their cruell crafts <hi>in tenebris:</hi> yet if that foreſight and circumſpection be had, which the ſubtiltie of ſuch houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould enemies requireth, I doubt not but it ſhal be eaſie to eſpie the Woolfe, though he wander in ſheepes clothing, by the manner of his howling; and the Aſſe, though he iet in the Lions skinne, by the length of his eares.</p>
               <p>Before I proceede further,<note place="margin">A linſie wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie religion.</note> I will here admoniſh that kinde of our goſpellers that are of a linſie woolſie religion, common pedlars and patchers of Chriſt his coate, which had no ſeame in deede: Who becauſe they are better affected to the ſtate then the former, I would be loath to tearme them Foxes; and yet hauing no warrant for a particoloured profeſſion, I may not honour them with the title of ſound Chriſtians: you ſhall know them by theſe colours. They hold it a matter of charitie to ſay God
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:12523:71"/> haue mercie on the ſoules of the dead: and ſhow them their errour; then they reply, what ſhall we bid the deuill goe with them? Their <hi>aue maria</hi> ſticks cloſe betwixt their teeth, though their <hi>Pater Noſter</hi> was forgot many yeeres agoe. They cannot be well perſwaded of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren dieng without Baptiſme: therfore they cry out for headlong haſt to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this ſacrament. They wil not beleeue that it is a ſinfull and ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thing, to ſweare by the Saints, and euery other creature; and when they are tould that it is a robbing God of his honour, they fall a woundering at the verie firſt principles of religion. Thus the Serpent gets his ground by creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and where Sathan cannot get an ell, he will take an ynch; hoping by little ynches of ſuperſtition, in the end, to make vp an ell of Idolatrie: and thus by little and little, Poperie hath ſtolne into the Church. Thoſe that are thus tainted, I exhort in the feare of God to reade the ſcriptures, and to heare his word, the knowledge whereof, is able to purge them from theſe filthie dregs of the Babiloniſh cup.</p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:12523:71"/>
               <p>Hauing ſpoken of Foxes hereticall,<note place="margin">Foxes ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall.</note> who moſt of all endaunger the ſaftie of the Church: it followeth that we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat of Foxes ſchiſmaticall, which of late yeares haue peeped out of their denne, to the diſturbance of our peace. Theſe are they whom in auncient time they called Cathariſts, as alſo the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſt Browinſts,<note place="margin">Browniſtes.</note> wee commonly call them: imagining a perfect beautie of a Church in this world, and ſeuering themſelues from all others, as if in their particular conuenticles this perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were to be found; in whom behold a two fould errour.

Secondly, in that theſe mote catchers ſee a mote in the eye of an other, and will not ſee the beame in their owne eyes; this is blind ſingularitie. For if they ſpeake of manners, they ſhould know that how corrupt ſo euer they are, either in the paſtour, or in the ſheepe, they may not inforce this outragious concluſion, that where ſuch corruptions are found, there is a nullitie of the Church, ſo long

               <p>Againe, if they ſpeake of imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of doctrine, many circumſtances are to be conſidered before wee depriue any aſſemblie, great or ſmall, of the name of a Church. In the Church of Corinth, not onely touching manners, the diſcipline of the Church was looſly obſerued;<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.17.</note> ſinceritie of preaching, by an affected kinde of babbling was much prophaned: but alſo a <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> houl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, touching the reſurrection of the fleſh, an article of ſuch weight, that withouten it the preaching of the word ſhould be in vaine; and yet Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:12523:72"/> houlds the name of a Church. The Galathians were moſt of them turned aſide by the falſe Apoſtles from free iuſtification, which is the principall ground-plat of the chriſtian Church; and yet notwithſtanding, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> giues them the name of a Church. The like is to be ſeene by that which the Apoſtle writeth to <hi>Timothie,</hi>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing before declared the conditions and manners of theſe Foxes which deſtroy the vines: it followeth next in order that we ſpeake ſomething concerning the vnkenel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of theſe Romiſh Foxes, which of all other are moſt daungerous to the ſtate, both of Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. The which we ſhall performe the better if we ſtill compare a Foxe with a Foxe. Now firſt of all it is well knowne to Foxe-hunters, that the Foxe holds the ſtrongeſt couerts, that he fli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from the field as a beaſt which tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth not in the ſwiftnes of his legs,<note place="margin">Properties of a Foxe when he is in chaſe.</note> nor the ſtrength of his bodie, that he whee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth about the thickets, and though he find none other helpe but a buſh, he wil flie to it for his ſafegard: ſo it is with this
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:12523:76"/> kind of cattell for being hunted, they runne abroad here and there, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially fly from the fields into the woods,<note place="margin">Whither the two-legged Foxes flie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hunted.</note> enquiring where there is one that makes no conſcience of his miniſterie, that will be content for handfuls of barley, and morſels of bread, for tyth cockes, and tyth ſheaues to cloake a Catholickes knauerie; enquiring alſo where there is an vntaught people, fit for all religions, and all princes raignes, and conſequently apt to ſwallow a bait of poiſoned perſwaſion; that is a couert for a Catholick, thither flock the Foxes, and feed without feare.</p>
               <p>Againe, another propertie of the Foxe is,<note place="margin">How the Foxes make their kenels.</note> to make his denne in the ground that is hard to dig, as in galt, clay, or ſuch like earth, the paſſage into his earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtreight, and going very farre in before it come to his couch, hauing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo many holes thorow which to vnearth himſelfe: Euen ſo it is with this kind, they make their burrowes ſtrong, they haue ſo many ſtreight paſſages, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny muſes, ſo many winding corners, ſo many turnings, ſo many interturnings, and ſtarting holes, that it is a matter full

For experience hath taught vs, that when it hath beene a matter vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that a Foxe prieſt hath beene readie to ſay maſſe, and therefore his denne hath beene compaſſed, the terriers haue winded him, and all his pretie trinkets haue been found prepared for ſo great a peece of worke: yet in the ende the Foxe would not be found. Perhaps he ſerues the hunters now and then, as the fiſh called the Cuttle ſerues the fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, which when ſhe is like to be taken caſteth forth a ſlimie humor like vnto ynke, and ſo darkning the vpper part of the water, and dazeling the fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans eies, marres his aime, and eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the daunger. Which ſithens it is ſo, the greater the care ought to be, that there be ſuch godly wiſedome and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in hunting them, ſuch toiles, ſuch nets as are fit for ſuch ſeruice, that there be ſuch miniſters as are able to handle

               <p>Againe, the Foxe hath many wiles wherby to make theſe Foxe-hounds at a fault, or to hunt counter; &amp; eſpecially he hath a mixture made of cogworth broad way,<note place="margin">Vox populi.</note> &amp; penimate together with a few ratle flowers called goold maries, or mary-goolds, which being ſteeped in a little diuels milke, &amp; caſt into their eies makes them ſtarke blind, &amp; ſtops their ſents: &amp; hence it commeth to paſſe that popery beareth ſuch ſwindge, becauſe papiſts can pay wel, &amp; that adultery &amp; fornication ſcape without puniſhment, becauſe wantons haue money.

               <p>There be two principall reaſons, why the Lord ſuffereth theſe houſhold ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to be in the midſt of his vineyard, the firſt is for the probation and trial of his ſeruants, whether they be vnfained<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly coupled vnto him, in the ſpirituall bond of faith and of loue.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.</note> If there ariſe amongſt you (ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi>) a Prophet, or &amp;c. Thou ſhalt not harke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words of that Prophet, or vnto that dreamer of dreams. For the Lord your God proueth you, to know whether you loue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord your God with al your heart &amp; with all your ſoule. And indeed it is necaſſarie that we be kept in continual exerciſe of faith and praier, of patience, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie: and therefore is it ſaid, that the Lord would not caſt out before his people of Iſrael any of the natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which <hi>Ioſua</hi> left when he died, that through them he might proue Iſraell whether they would keepe his waies to walke therein or no? And to this effect Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</note> that there muſt be hereſies
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:12523:80"/> that they which are approued might be knowne.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Corin.</hi> 11.</note> Where alſo that of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> is worthie remembrance, let vs vſe he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes (ſaith he) not to that end to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue their errours, but that by defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Catholickes doctrine againſt their deceits, we may be more watchful and warie: becauſe it is moſt truly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, there muſt be hereſies, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tried &amp; approued may be manifeſted or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered from the holow harts amongſt you. Let vs vſe this benefit of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence: for heretikes are made of ſuch as would erre or be naught, thogh they were in the Church: but being out, they profit vs exceedingly, not by teaching the truth which they know not, but by ſtirring vp the carnall in the Church, to ſeeke truth, and the ſpirituall to cleare the truth. Thus then it is apparant, that both the weaker and the ſtronger, the carnall and the ſpirituall may profit by hereſies and ſchiſmes which the Lord ſuffereth in his Church; the one by lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the other by teaching: for they ſhall trie our faith, and our loue, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we be counterfeits, &amp; diſſemblers; whether we wil be ſuddainly wind-ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:12523:80"/> whether we will forſake the truth, and follow falſehood; or whether faith be grounded in our hearts or no? For like as in the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> God ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red great magitians to be in Aegypt, that he might make his owne power more euident in <hi>Moſes:</hi> ſo he ſuffereth heretikes, as ſorcerers or enchanters, to be in the Church, that the power of praier, of faith, of loue, of zeale, might be more apparant. A crab oftentimes carrieth the coat of an apple, and is not well knowne but by the taſte; copper hath the colour of gold, &amp; is not ſo well tried as by the touch: an hypocrite may lurcke vnder the ſhadow of a beleeuer, and is not throughly manifeſted vntill his faith be tried; but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beliefe of Gods children is like vnto the glaze-worme which glittereth moſt brightly in the darkeſt night, or like y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lampe that giues moſt light in the darke. But ſome will ſay, alas we are no clearkes, and in theſe diuiſions and diſputings, here is euery one alledging ſcripture for himſelfe, what ſhall we doe, or what courſe ſhall we take that are vnlearned? For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter helping of you in this hazard, firſt
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:12523:81"/> looke whether euerie one alledgeth ſcripture or no? for that goeth for ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture many times, with the Catholicks, which is no more to be found in the booke of the Bible the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Paradiſe in hell. Secondly, know them to be falſe teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which for confirmation of doctrine of faith alledge any other teſtimonies, ouer and beſides the ſcriptures: for mans writings are no further to be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited, then they bring warrant from the word of God, which containeth the whole counſell of God touching our ſaluation. If they reply, that all is not written which the Apoſtles taught, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere them with that which is ſaid by the Apoſtle, who requireth nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the ſcriptures to make the man of God complete: then compare their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written traditions with Gods written truth, the light will ſtraight diſcouer their darknes.

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:12523:81"/> articles of faith, the briefe abridgments of chriſtian religion: and then if thou bringeſt with thee a teachable minde, and a deſire to learne in humilitie, thou ſhalt not erre, but finde Chriſt in his owne home, that is, in his word.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon why the Lord ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth his Church to be troubled with deceitfull companions, is his proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable iuſtice againſt the vnbeleeuers: And that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> meaneth when he ſaith, that when men haue no minde to obey God and his truth,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.10.</note> hee ſendeth them falſe prophets euen with an effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie and ſpeedines of errour. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiling of <hi>Achab</hi> ſhoweth this eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently. Who is it, ſaith God, that ſhall deceiue <hi>Achab?</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, I ſee that he will needs be drawne vnto the bottome of hell; for the wretch was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed with his Idols, had peruerted Gods ſeruice, was full of all ſtubbornnes,<note place="margin">2. <hi>King.</hi> 22.2.</note> and malice againſt the prophets, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue no admonition. Therefore God ſeeing him a man forlorne, ſendeth a lying ſpirit to beguile him. But here marke one thing eſpecially comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Gods childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that when God had
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:12523:82"/> giuen Sathan commiſſion to execute his vengeance vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the vnbeleeuers, he not onely giueth him leaue to puniſh them with loſſe of goods, ſicknes of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, &amp;c. but giues powre to leade them into errour, vtterly to deceiue them and to carrie them away with lies. This is apparant in the hiſtorie of the triall of <hi>Iob</hi> where Sathan his firſt commiſſion is to touch his goods, and the ſecond, to touch his body: but he may not meddle with his ſoule. Thus you ſee, it ſtandeth both with the manifeſtation both of the mercie and iuſtice of God, to ſend deceitfull work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men into his Church.</p>

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:12523:93"/> In expiation behold foure ſpeciall points: firſt, that the word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokeneth a full and entire paiment of all that is due vnto God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that which is due, is death according to the ſentence giuen by God himſelfe,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Thirdly, this expiation betokeneth not the payment for one ſinner, but for all ſinners, I meane the elect which haue been, are, or ſhall be to the ende of the world, not of one ſinne, but of all ſinnes: except that againſt the holy ghoſt which is vnpardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, this paiment was to be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by him, who in reſpect of himſelfe ſhould be no way bound to this maledi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ction,

                  <p>As for ſinnes going before Baptiſme, they grant that they are pardoned throughly in regard of the guilt, and the paine, and that by ſome meanes of the vertue of the ſacred water with the

                  <p>Beſides, the ſpirit of lying hath ſo controuled, and countermaunded the obligation once made for all by Ieſus Chriſt, that he hath borne men in hand that the ſame muſt euery day be really and actually reiterated.

Contrariwiſe it is want of loue in the miniſter, if he do not feed: and what is it in the patrone, if by his careleſnes this come to paſſe? It is a fault to giue the calling to him that is vnworthie, &amp; no fault to giue the liuing vnto him? In the ſixth of S. <hi>Markes</hi> goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell it is ſaid of Chriſt, that going out &amp; ſeeing a great multitude of people gathered together, he had compaſſion on them, becauſe they were like ſheep without a ſhepheard: It is a neceſſary conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that if Chriſts bowels earn to ſee his ſheep depriued of a ſhepherd, that he will make your hearts ake that are the cauſe of this horrible ſinne. I am aſhamed to rehearſe how the Church of god is abuſed by you, who in beſtowing your Church-liuings giuing them not to miniſters, as miniſters; but as to your ſons, or your ſeruants or your kinſmen, or to ſome other that by ſome by-deſert hath gained your fauours: and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:12523:113"/> the true Church teacheth that the charge of publike religion doth not in part,<note place="margin">Charge of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to the Magiſtrate.</note> but principally, and moſt of all belong vnto the magiſtrate, which thing the holy ſcripture approueth. <hi>Moſes</hi> the firſt generall magiſtrate of the Iſraelites,<note place="margin">God gaue the order of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Moſes not to Aaron.</note> who did not repreſent the perſon of a prieſt, which was put vnto <hi>Aaron,</hi> but of the ſuperiour power like vnto the authoritie of a king, did giue the order of al religion vnto the people, &amp; appointed vnto <hi>Aaron</hi> &amp; the order of the prieſts what they ſhould do, &amp; what they ſhould not do.

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:12523:122"/> his heate, and influence doth nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh plantes, trees, and hearbes; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort alſo and giue ſtrength vnto them, to exerciſe their ſeuerall properties: ſo good lawes nouriſh and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the flouriſhing ſtate of king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes; as on the other ſide without theſe, there can be nothing elſe but diſorder and vtter confuſion. But yet it may not be forgotten,<note place="margin">Execution the life of the law.</note> that as good lawes are the liues of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths: ſo execution is the life of the lawe; for lawes are better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made then vnkept: and our lawes ſeeme like to Spiders webbes, where-through the buzzing Bees, Hornets, or horſe-flies doe breake; but the poore feeble flies hang faſt. If this were not ſo, you ſhould haue few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Gentlemen theeues, fewer Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen adulterers, fewer Gentlemen idolaters. And who knoweth not that although a Citie were defended with walles of Braſſe; yet if there want men and munition, in time they will be beaten downe: euen ſo though lawes were neuer ſo wiſely made; yet if they want ſuch as ſhall vrge their
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:12523:122"/> obedience and defend them, they will ſoone prooue nothing worth. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſaying of <hi>Solon</hi> is worthie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce, who being asked when the Commonwealth did moſt flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, aunſwered, when the people o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the Magiſtrate, and the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate obeyeth the lawe.</p>
               <p>Againe, for the right proceeding in iudgement againſt hereticall perſons,<note place="margin">Two things to be reproued in an heretike:</note> you muſt conſider that there be two things worthie to bee reprooued in an hereticke-ſeducer; for a difference is to be made betwixt the ſeducer, the grand Captaine or Ringleader, and the poore ſeelie wretch ſeduced. Now in the ſeducer there is firſt his here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie; and ſecondly, the ſcatteringe of his hereſie, whereby he goeth about to infect and poyſon others. Theſe ſeed-men of ſuperſtition and hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſcatterers, muſt be better looked vnto, that the multitude may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from ſeduction:<note place="margin">Seducing heretikes.</note> or elſe great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger will growe not onely to Chriſt his Church by poiſoning and peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the puritie of religion; but to the ſtate of the land, by daily addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:12523:123"/> of ſtrength to the Romiſh facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is too well knowne how faſt our Papiſts doe encreaſe in many parts of this land; and how daily one draweth another into the pit of perdition: ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the fault is either in the miniſter or magiſtrate, or elſe in both. But this is a ſure thing, that as Poperie getteth ground; ſo the Goſpell looſeth ground: and where ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſwimmeth, there religion ſincketh. Laſtly, whether they wiſh the life or the death of her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties perſon, by whoſe moſt gracious go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment true religion is continued, who are ſo hotly deuoted to ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; let the former reaſons againſt all perfect papiſts determine.<note place="margin">Seduced peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> As for the ſeduced and poore deceiued wretches, all meanes are to be practiſed for their conuerſions: but when as once it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that they are not onely ignorant, but obſtinately and wilfully ignorant, and that the more they be forborne, the leſſe they are reformed; like vnto the vine that proſpereth with no pruning, or the hearb that withereth with wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: what can remaine elſe, but that where milde and temperate medicines
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:12523:123"/> can take no effect, there be vſed violent meanes, as ſharpe coroſiues: and why not cauterie &amp; inciſion, leaſt that grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inconuenience grow either by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, which giueth encouragement, or by corruption which comes by their companie. Therefore the wholeſome counſell of the Poet is to be hearkened vnto, where he ſaith:
